CRUD Frontend with React

This is a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) frontend application built with React that communicates with a Django REST framework backend. The application provides a user interface for creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting resources in the database through RESTful APIs.

### Installation
To run the application locally, you need to have Node.js and npm installed on your machine. Follow these steps to get started:

*Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
    git clone git@github.com:JuanCarlosAguilarB/litethinking-react.git
```
* Change directory to the root of the project:

```bash
    cd lite-thinking-front
```

* Build the Docker image:

```bash
    docker-compose build
```
* Run the Docker container:

```bash
    docker-compose up -d
```
This will start the application and make it available at http://localhost:3000/

## Usage
Once the application is running, you can use the user interface to interact with the backend APIs and perform CRUD operations on the resources in the database.

The application provides a list view and a detail view for each resource. The list view displays a list of all the resources, and the detail view displays the details of a specific resource. You can create, update, and delete resources using the appropriate buttons and forms in the user interface.
